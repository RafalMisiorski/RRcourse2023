_Barrry_ is an American dark comedy-crime television series created by Alec Berg and Bill Hader that premiered on HBO. It stars Hader as the titular character, a hitman from the Midwest who travels to Los Angeles to kill someone and then finds himself joining an acting class taught by Henry Winkler's character.

Here is a summary of some basic statistics on viewership (in Millions):

```{r}
# Create a data frame with the viewership data
barry_data <- data.frame(
  episode = c(1:28),
  viewers = c(0.564, 0.641, 0.595, 0.511, 0.643, 0.560, 0.636, 0.548, 0.532, 0.424, 1.78, 1.94, 2.03, 1.99, 1.87, 2.21, 0.249, 0.294, 0.299, 0.270, 0.257, 0.210, 0.261, 0.221, 0.274, 0.216, 0.208, 0.303)
)

# Calculate the mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation
mean_viewers <- mean(barry_data$viewers)
median_viewers <- median(barry_data$viewers)
min_viewers <- min(barry_data$viewers)
max_viewers <- max(barry_data$viewers)
sd_viewers <- sd(barry_data$viewers)

# Display the statistics
cat("Mean viewership: ", mean_viewers, "\n")
cat("Median viewership: ", median_viewers, "\n")
cat("Minimum viewership: ", min_viewers, "\n")
cat("Maximum viewership: ", max_viewers, "\n")
cat("Standard deviation of viewership: ", sd_viewers, "\n")

```

3. Create a graph of viewership over time:

```r
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)


ggplot(barry_data, aes(x = episode, y = viewers)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Episode Number", y = "Viewership (millions)", title = "Barry Viewership Over Time")

```



4. Create a graph of episode-to-episode changes in viewership:


```{r}
barry_data <- barry_data %>%
  mutate(viewership_change = viewers - lag(viewers))
```

4. The graph of the episode-to-episode (or season-to-season) changes in viewership:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Create a separate dataframe for the text labels
text_data <- data.frame(x = c(8, 16, 24), y = rep(max(barry_data$viewership_change), 3), label = c("8", "16", "24"))


ggplot(barry_data, aes(x = episode, y = viewers)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(8, 16, 24), linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  geom_text(aes(label = viewers), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
  labs(x = "Episode Number", y = "Viewership (millions)", title = "Barry Viewership Over Time")



```
